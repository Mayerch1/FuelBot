Privacy Notice for **FuelBot**

Please note that this bot is **not** a service provided by or affiliated with Discord Inc.
This notice has no implications on the *Discord Privacy notice*. Both documents coexist independently.

__**Data collection**__
The bot does not collect or store any user data.
The bot does not forward any user data to third parties.

Whenever a command is invoked, the entered data is temporarily held in volatile memory, which is discarded on completion of the command. The invocation of the command itself is not logged (see: *Error case*).

__Data Request__
You cannot request your data, as there is no data stored to be requested.

__Deletion Request__
You cannot request a deletion of your data, as there is no data stored to be deleted.

__**Error case**__
In case a command causes an unexpected error, a so called `Stack-Trace` is dumped into log files.
This stack trace does log the invocation of a command, but does not contain any personal information.

This privacy policy itself may be updated or extended without prior warning or notification.
